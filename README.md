news as git style

what about news tracking system like git mechanism? 
there're lots of issues we should be care of in the world. but we don't take care of all kind of news because we don't have enough time to track. I'm sure some news are linked with specific keywords and issues which means we can connect that kind of news like github as version control management system. every news and issue should be printed as history to make bad case again. 

that is our obligation to hand over next generation. 

to do will be as below: 
1. automation system to search news and classify keyword in the internet. 
2. generation serial number for news company, agency, press and etc. 
3. every news will have ticket with keyword and serial number. 
4. robot archives those news with ticket and make a link. 
5. we can see how to connect them and where to come and go in a page. 

press system will be similar to github. 
every news will issue as repository in github. follow-up report have ticket from initial news. related report but another issue branch from that news with thier own ticket and initial ticket.
